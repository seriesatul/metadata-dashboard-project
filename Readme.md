## üöÄ Core Features

*   **Interactive Data Table:** A paginated and searchable table displays a complete list of datasets with key information like owner, freshness, and tags.
*   **Powerful Search & Filtering:**
    *   Filter datasets in real-time by name or tags.
    *   **Conversational Search:** A proof-of-concept natural language filter (e.g., "show datasets updated last week").
*   **Detailed Asset View:** Clicking a dataset opens a side drawer with comprehensive metadata, including:
    *   **Schema Browser:** A clear view of column names, data types, and descriptions.
    *   **Data Lineage:** A visual diagram showing upstream sources and downstream consumers.
    *   **Usage Analytics:** Interactive charts built with **Recharts** to visualize query volume and freshness trends over time.
*   **GraphQL Backend:** A mock GraphQL API built with `apollo-server` serves realistic, paginated data and handles complex filtering logic.
*   **Responsive Design:** The UI is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices, thanks to Material UI's robust grid system.
*   **Performance Optimized:**
    *   **Lazy Loading:** The detailed view drawer and its heavy charting components are lazy-loaded to improve initial page load times.
    *   **Debounced Search:** API calls are debounced to prevent excessive requests while the user is typing.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

To run this project on your local machine, you will need two separate terminal windows.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm or yarn

### 1. Backend Server (`metadata-api`)

First, start the GraphQL API server.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/seriesatul/metadata-dashboard-project.git
cd metadata-dashboard-project

# 2. Navigate to the backend directory
cd metadata-api

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the server
npm start
```
The API server will be running at `http://localhost:4000`.

### 2. Frontend Application (`metadata-dashboard`)

In a **new terminal window**, start the React frontend application.

```bash
# 1. (If not already there) Navigate to the project's root directory
cd path/to/metadata-dashboard-project

# 2. Navigate to the frontend directory
cd metadata-dashboard

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start the development server
npm run dev
```
The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).

## üåê Deployment

This monorepo project is deployed as two separate services:

*   The **React frontend** is deployed as a static site on **Vercel**, configured to use the `metadata-dashboard` directory as its root.
*   The **Node.js/GraphQL backend** is deployed as a web service on **Render**, configured to use the `metadata-api` directory as its root.

Continuous deployment is enabled via GitHub. Any push to the `master` branch will automatically trigger new builds on both platforms.
